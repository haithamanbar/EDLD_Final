# Dominik Grätz - Journey
  
* I knew some basics about coding in R, but did not make full use of the `{tidyverse}`

  * Before, I have used functions from the `{plyr}` package 
    <br> &rarr; `{tidyverse}` functions make life so much easier!
    
  * For filtering, for example, I still like to use indexing instead of using `filter()`, but mostly because I am more used to that and can code faster that way (for now):
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
data <- data[is.na(data$Response),] #vs.
data <- data %>% filter(!is.na(Response))
```

* Similarly, I still sometimes use base R column manipulation instead of `mutate()` when I think it's faster.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data$RT <- data$RT * 2 #vs.
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(RT = RT * 2)
```

# Dominik Grätz - Challenges faced

* Sometimes, I HATE Markdown, but I love the output and cleanliness.

* I need to learn more about tables - I made the table below by hand but haven't found a convenient solution with the packages that exist that produces indentation like this and multiple columns.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%",fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("table.png") 

```

* Collaboration was great! We took some time to boil the questions down, but it was a great working with a team having experiences in different areas!
* I am still not certain I fully understand Github...

---

# Dominik Grätz - Challenges in the future

* In the future, for my work, I would like to produce plots like this (but nice): 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%",fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("circularplot.png") 

```

* I have not found a package that produces nice circular (rose) plots - may need to switch to Matlab for that?

* I also want to produce appealing interactive maps that display information about voting, demographics, prevalence of illnesses, things like that. <br> &rarr; Excited for the data viz class!

  **Using experimental vs. secondary data**
  
  * I usually work with experimental data,  where throughout the research process I've had control over variables and measurement. Using secondary data means:
  
    * Takes hours to understand the data 
    
    * Takes hours to figure out which variables are relevant

```{r Rachel_image1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", eval=FALSE}

# Code or image showing messy variables transformed into clean

knitr::include_graphics("Group_presentation/Rachels_images/colnames_original.png") #Stuck on error message "cannot find the file(s)"

```

    * Taking hours to understand the data

    * Not everything is measured the way you wish it was

```{r Rachel_image3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", eval=FALSE}

# code or image showing variable not nicely aligning with our construct.

**Working alone vs. with others**

* Unfamiliar research area = steep learning curve

* Workflow kinks (e.g., merge issues, forgetting to push to GitHub, modeling and graphing dependent on data cleaning)

* Having others who know code that you don't, and who can double-check your code with fresh eyes (shout out to Tian and Dominik!)

```{r}

#INSERT ANY RELEVANT CODE YOU WANT TO SHOW HERE

#knitr::include_graphics("image.png") <-- use this code to insert any image you want

```

# Rachel Miller-Moudgil (3/3)

**My next R hurdle**

* Pivot_longer and pivot_wider: concept & code

* Reviewing citation packages & code

```{r }

#INSERT ANY RELEVANT CODE YOU WANT TO SHOW HERE

#knitr::include_graphics("image.png") <-- use this code to insert any image you want

```

# Amber Somarriba

INSERT BULLET POINTS ABOUT THE CODING CHALLENGES YOU FACED HERE

* Presentation cover the following:
  
    * Share your journey (everyone, at least for a minute or two)

    * Discuss challenges you had along the way

    * Celebrate your successes

    * Discuss challenges you are still facing

    * Discuss substantive findings

    * Show off your cool figures!
  
    * Discuss next R hurdle you want to address

```{r }

#INSERT ANY RELEVANT CODE YOU WANT TO SHOW HERE

# Tian Walker

Coding Challenges

  * create a variable with 3 levels (case_when)
  
  * creating bar graphs (geom_bar vs. geom_col)
  
  * loading in duplicate variables that are empty
  
  * learning how to read between the lines with error    messages
