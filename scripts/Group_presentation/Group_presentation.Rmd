#A dashed line (---) represents the start of a new slide. A hashtag (#) represents a heading. An asterisks (*) represents a bullet point. A double asterisks (**) turns the fond bold. And within each slide, you have option of adding in any r code you want to bring in graphs or images, using the typical hash marks (```).

--- begin new slide

# Heading

* bullet 1
* bullet 2
* bullet 3
    * sub bullet 1
    * sub bullet 2

**bold comment**
  
--- begin new slide

#Code to pull in an image (if you want to bring in images or screenshots):

  INSERT BULLET POINTS ABOUT THE CODING CHALLENGES YOU FACED HERE

* Presentation cover the following:
  
    * Share your journey (everyone, at least for a minute or two)

    * Discuss challenges you had along the way

    * Celebrate your successes

    * Discuss challenges you are still facing

    * Discuss substantive findings

    * Show off your cool figures!
  
   * Discuss next R hurdle you want to address

```{r }

#INSERT ANY RELEVANT CODE YOU WANT TO SHOW HERE

#knitr::include_graphics("image.png") <-- use this code to insert any image you want

  # Rachel Miller-Moudgil (1/3)
  
  **Using experimental vs. secondary data**
  
  * I usually work with experimental data,  where throughout the research process I've had control over variables and measurement. Using secondary data means:
  
    * Takes hours to understand the data 
    
    * Takes hours to figure out which variables are relevant

```{r Rachel_image1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", eval=FALSE}

# Code or image showing messy variables transformed into clean

knitr::include_graphics("Group_presentation/Rachels_images/colnames_original.png") #Stuck on error message "cannot find the file(s)"

```

    * Taking hours to understand the data

    * Not everything is measured the way you wish it was

```{r Rachel_image3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", eval=FALSE}

# code or image showing variable not nicely aligning with our construct.

**Working alone vs. with others**

* Unfamiliar research area = steep learning curve

* Workflow kinks (e.g., merge issues, forgetting to push to GitHub, modeling and graphing dependent on data cleaning)

* Having others who know code that you don't, and who can double-check your code with fresh eyes (shout out to Tian and Dominik!)

```{r}

#INSERT ANY RELEVANT CODE YOU WANT TO SHOW HERE

#knitr::include_graphics("image.png") <-- use this code to insert any image you want

**My next R hurdle**

* Pivot_longer and pivot_wider: concept & code

* Reviewing citation packages & code

```{r }
